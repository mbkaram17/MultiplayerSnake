1 - Key bindings are listed in Main, ability to add more. You can only have as many players as there are keybindings.
	- Initial controls are A,W,D,S for player 1 and J,I,L,K for player 2
2 - To change board size, modify size of window in html and the swf-build header 

3 - Player number, snake speed and frame speed is changed in Main. Frame speed is how often the game updates, and snake speed is
    how much the snake moves per update.

4 - Player snakes are its own class, so you have the potential to create one, and add functions to behave like an AI

5 - Current bug where colission between two heads will not kill the players

6 - I unforunately couldnt think of a good way to make sure the apple won't spawn on other snakes. 

At the very least, I hope you enjoy the game! Thanks!!!
